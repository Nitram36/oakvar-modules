# GWAS Catalog

The Catalog was founded by the NHGRI in 2008, in response to the rapid increase in the number of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  The GWAS Catalog provides a consistent, searchable, visualisable and freely available database of published SNP-trait associations.  The catalog aims to curate eligible studies within 1-2 months of publication, and the data is released on a weekly cycle.  The data are curated by a team of experienced molecular biologists. For more details about the Catalog curation process and data extraction procedures, please refer to the Methods page.
As of 2019-07-30, the GWAS Catalog contains 4085 publications and 149855 associations. GWAS Catalog data is currently mapped to Genome Assembly GRCh38.p12 and dbSNP Build 151.
