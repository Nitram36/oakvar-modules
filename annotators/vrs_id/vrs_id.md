# vrs_id
### A module for annotating single nucleotide variants with their corresponding VRS ID
The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) recently introduced the Variant Representation Specification (VRS); a computational framework designed to facilitate and improve sharing of genetic information. VRS defines precise terminology for describing genetic variants and provides a means for storing and sharing variants unambiguously. The specification also provides a way to define a specific variant using a unique computed identifier, or VRS id. This module enables annotation of single nucleotide variants with their corresponding VRS computed identifier.
